# CAPITAL

### Alignment of time-course single-cell RNA-seq data

Last updated: 2019-11-29

We present CAPITAL, a method for comparing pseudotime trajectories with tree alignment whereby trajectories including branching can be compared without any knowledge of paths to be compared.

## Requirements
* Python 3

## Required modules
* matplotlib
* networkx
* numpy
* pandas
* scanpy
* scipy
* sklearn
* tslearn

## Usage
Type the followings in your terminal:
```
$ tar zxf capital-0.0.1.tar.gz
$ cd capital-0.0.1
$ ./capital.py
```
**Note:**
The current version of CAPITAL is only for test use.
More stable and user-friendly version will be available soon.
