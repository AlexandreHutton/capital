CAPITAL - Comparative pseudotime analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data
========================================================================

We present CAPITAL, a method for comparing pseudotime trajectories with tree alignment whereby trajectories
including branching can be compared without any knowledge of paths to be compared.
To see methods used in CAPITAL, read `our paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/859751v1>`_.
